# Artificial Intelligence

Coursework for CSc 44800 - Artificial Intelligence at The City College of New York Spring 2022.

## `equation_of_a_slime.ipynb`

This assignment covers Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression, Cross Validation, and Polynomial Regression.

## `judging_flowers.ipynb`

This assignment covers Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier, Neural Network (MLP Classifier), and K Nearest Neighbors Classifier with Iris dataset.

In this assignment, I also experiment with different options for the Neural Network.

## `example_notebook.ipynb`

This main goal of this assignment was to get exposure to Jupyter Notebook and Google Collab.

In this assignment, I covered Different Types of Interpolation. Specifically, I covered Piecewise Linear Approximation, Lagrange Interpolation, Newton's Divided-Difference Interpolation, and Newton's Forward-Difference Interpolation.
