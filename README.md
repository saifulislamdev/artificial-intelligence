# Artificial Intelligence

## `equation_of_a_slime.ipynb`

This assignment covers Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression, Cross Validation, and Polynomial Regression

## `judging_flowers.ipynb`

This assignment coverse Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier, Neural Network (MLP Classifier), K Nearest Neighbors Classifier with Iris dataset.

I also experimented with different options for the Neural Network.

## `example_notebook.ipynb`

This main goal of this assignment was to get exposure to Jupyter Notebook and Google Collab.

In this assignment, I covered Different Types of Interpolation. Specifically, I covered Piecewise Linear Approximation, Lagrange Interpolation, Newton's Divided-Difference Interpolation, and Newton's Forward-Difference Interpolation.
